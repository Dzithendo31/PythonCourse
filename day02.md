It seems like you might have a typo in your question. I assume you meant "ternary operators."

In Python, the ternary operator is a concise way to write a conditional expression. It has the form:

'''python
Copy code
x if condition else y
It evaluates the condition. If it is True, the result is x; otherwise, the result is y.
'''
Here's an example:

python
Copy code
age = 25
message = "You are young" if age < 30 else "You are not so young"
print(message)
In this example, if age is less than 30, the value of message will be "You are young"; otherwise, it will be "You are not so young."

Ternary operators are useful for writing concise and readable code when you have simple conditional assignments.
