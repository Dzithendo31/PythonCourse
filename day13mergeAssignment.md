**Assignment - Rebase, Squash - Normal Merge**

Squash will keep the changes from the branch and remove the individual commits from the history, this works when you have too many commits on a single feature(branch), so you combine them onto the master as a single commit.

Rebase and merge is, they move the entire branch and rewrite the history to reflect this.

Squash and merge prioritize a cleaner and more concise commit history, while rebase and merge preserves the details of the individual commits, providing a more granular view of the development process.
